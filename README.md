# ETHZ School work
This repository contains the materials and code for two courses: "Fundamentals of Machine Learning" and "Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence". The courses are organized into folders, each containing multiple subprojects with specific focus areas.

## Fundamentals of Machine Learning
This course covers the basics of machine learning and feature engineering, with an emphasis on practical implementation and real-world applications. The course is divided into three subprojects:

1. Basic ML Methods and Feature Engineering
This subproject introduces the core concepts of machine learning and provides hands-on experience with common ML algorithms. It also covers essential feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.

2. Siamese Convolutional Network Build-up
In this subproject, you will learn how to build and train a Siamese Convolutional Network for tasks such as image recognition and similarity measurement. We will explore the underlying concepts and best practices for implementing these types of networks.

3. Molecule Structure Prediction
This subproject focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to predict molecular structures. We will explore various algorithms and models suitable for this task, and discuss the challenges and opportunities in this domain.

## Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence
The Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence course delves into advanced probabilistic methods and their application to AI systems. The course is divided into four subprojects:

1. Gaussian Processes
This subproject introduces Gaussian Processes, a powerful probabilistic modeling technique. We will cover the basics of Gaussian Processes and demonstrate their applications in regression, classification, and more.

2. Bayesian Optimization
In this subproject, you will learn about Bayesian Optimization, an efficient method for optimizing complex, expensive-to-evaluate functions. We will discuss the underlying principles and explore practical applications of this technique.

3. Bayesian Neural Networks
This subproject focuses on Bayesian Neural Networks, which combine the power of deep learning with probabilistic modeling. We will explore the benefits and challenges of Bayesian Neural Networks and learn how to implement them in various scenarios.

4. Reinforcement Learning (Actor-Critic)
In this subproject, we will cover the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and dive into the Actor-Critic framework. We will discuss the concepts behind this approach and learn how to implement it in practical applications.


Please refer to the respective folders for detailed information and code related to each subproject. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Enjoy learning!
